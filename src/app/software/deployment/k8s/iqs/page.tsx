                    <h5>Explain Kubernetes Architecture.</h5>
                    Kubernetes is an open-source container deployment and administration platform. It offers container orchestration, container runtime, container-centric infrastructure orchestration, balance of load, self-healing mechanisms, and service discovery. A Kubernetes cluster has several control planes and one or more worker nodes.

                    <h5>What is Container Orchestration?</h5>
                    Container orchestration is the automated process of managing and coordinating the deployment, scaling, networking, and lifecycle of containers. It simplifies the operational complexities of running applications packaged in containers, ensuring they are deployed efficiently and reliably in various environments, such as cloud, on-premises, or hybrid setups.

                    <h5>What is Kubelet?</h5>
                    The Kubelet is a key component of Kubernetes that runs on every node in a Kubernetes cluster. It is responsible for managing the lifecycle of containers on its node, ensuring they are running as defined in the PodSpec (pod specification). The Kubelet acts as an agent that communicates with the Kubernetes control plane to maintain the desired state of the cluster.                    <h6>Popular Container Orchestration Tools</h6>
