            SSL is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure
            communication over a network. It ensures data encryption,
            integrity, and authentication between a client and a server.
          </p>
          <p>
            SSL is an older protocol and has been deprecated in favor of TLS
            due to security vulnerabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong> SSL 3.0 is the last version of SSL, but it
            is no longer considered secure.

        <div className="card-body">
          <p>
            TLS is the successor to SSL and is more secure and efficient. It
            provides the same functionality as SSL (encryption, integrity, and
            authentication) but with stronger encryption algorithms and
            improved security features.
          </p>
          <p>
            TLS is widely used today, with versions like TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3
            being the most common.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong> HTTPS uses TLS to secure communication
            between a web browser and a server.

        </div>
        <div className="card-body">
          <p>
            mTLS is an extension of TLS where both the client and the server
            authenticate each other. In standard TLS, only the server is
            authenticated (e.g., via a server certificate). In mTLS, the client
            also presents a certificate to prove its identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            mTLS is commonly used in secure API communication, microservices,
            and zero-trust architectures.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong> A client application and a server both
            verify each other's certificates before establishing a connection.
